<h1> What is an "IFcoltransG"? </h1>

<p> And how did it get into my website? </p>

<p> I, IFcoltransG, am a human person.</p>

<p> I go by <em>they/them/their</em> pronouns, as in: "IFcoltransG has an About page where they talk about themself/themselves
and their human person creations." </p>
<p> Here are some links to things I've made: </p>
<ul>
  <% for link in Self::LINKS { %>
    <li>
      <%- link.render()? %>
    </li>
    <% } %>
</ul>

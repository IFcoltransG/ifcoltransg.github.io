    <h1> Dear reader ‚Äî </h1>
    <p> This site is for you, in a way. </p>
    <p> Perhaps you've met me, someday. Perhaps I know you're reading this. See
      this cool thing I made! </p>
    <p> Welcome. </p>
    <p> Perhaps you found this text by happenstance, you dredged those letters of my URL from the vestigial appendix of
      a dust-encrusted book, traced them with your eyes, typed each character into your own address bar. Hit
      return. </p>
    <p> Welcome. </p>
    <p> Whether we've crossed paths, you have me at some disadvantage. I cannot see you as I write to know who
      reads. This text was baked in advance, here's something I prepared earlier. I give the same words to every
      reader (you). </p>
    <p> And so this site is for me, in a way. </p>
    <p> So I can cross your path someday, excited almost to burst, and tell you about this cool thing I made. Hide the
      URL
      somewhere you'll find it. </p>
